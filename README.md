Aviation Accidents Analysis

Overview
This project explores aviation accident data from 1962 to 2013 to uncover patterns and insights to improve aviation safety. The analysis aims to aid airlines, manufacturers, and safety organizations in identifying critical risk factors and trends.

Objectives
1. Understand long-term trends in aviation accident frequency and severity.
2. Analyze accident rates by aircraft type, region, and specific airports.
3. Investigate key contributing factors like weather, mechanical issues, or human error.

Dataset
The dataset contains records of aviation accidents with attributes such as:
- Event date and location
- Aircraft type and model
- Weather conditions
- Severity indicators (e.g., fatalities, injuries)

Limitations
1. Missing data in several critical fields (e.g., maintenance records).
2. Potential biases due to incomplete reporting.
3. Data quality issues with duplicate and null values.

Methods
1. Data Cleaning:
   - Handled missing and duplicate entries.
   - Converted event dates into usable formats.
   - Analyzed and filtered columns like weather conditions, aircraft types, and fatalities.

2. Exploratory Analysis:
   - Trends over time in accident frequency and fatalities.
   - Analysis by aircraft model and accident location.
   - Relationship between weather conditions and accidents.

3. Visualization:
   - Created charts to highlight patterns, such as accident frequency by year or severity by region.

Results
1. Key Trends:
   - Identified years and regions with higher accident frequencies.
   - Highlighted models and categories of aircraft with the most incidents.

2. Risk Factors:
   - Established correlations between weather conditions and accidents.
   - Observed patterns linked to human error and mechanical failures.

Recommendations
1. Enhance data collection standards during investigations.
2. Prioritize safety measures for high-risk aircraft categories.
3. Improve predictive maintenance and weather forecasting systems.

Tools Used
- Programming: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Libraries: Data cleaning and visualization tools
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook
